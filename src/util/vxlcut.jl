    volfrac(voxel, nout, r₀)

Returns the volume fraction `rvol = vol(voxel ⋂ half-space) / vol(voxel)` that indicates how
much portion of the volume of a voxel is included the half-space defined by a plane.  The
result is between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.  Inside and outside of the half space is
determined by `nout`, which is the outward normal.  (If a point is on the `nout` side of the
plane, then it is outside.)

The voxel needs to be aligned with the Cartesian axes, and is described by `v =
([xn,yn,zn], [xp,yp,zp])` that specifies the x-, y-, z-boundaries of the voxel.  The
half-space is described by the boundary plane.  The boundary plane is described by the
outward normal vector `nout = [nx, ny, nz]` and a point `r₀ = [rx, ry, rz]` on the plane.
`nout` does not have to be normalized.
